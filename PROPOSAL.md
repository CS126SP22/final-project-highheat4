CS126 Final Project Proposal
For my final project, I would like to work on a natural selection simulator. This simulator would essentially have multiple different  “animals” that will survive only if they meet specific conditions. They will also only propagate upon meeting those specific conditions. Conditions can include finding food, not dying to other animals, and finding other animals for reproduction (optional implementation, can implement if I have extra time). Parameters for each animal include speed and energy. The main outcomes of this final project will be making sure that the animals can interact properly and reproduce properly, as well as making sure that there is food generation. Possible further implementations could include carnivores vs herbivores. I have experience with evolutionary concepts and I want to do this project as I feel a natural selection simulator would be fun to watch and tweak long term.
For week one, I would finish implementing the general abstract class for animals overall as well as creating a platform in which food will spawn over time. I would ideally also check for collision between food and animals.
For week two, I would finish implementing the animals within the platform and have the animals be able to eat from the food sources.
For week three, I would make it so that the animals can reproduce when they meet their reproduction criteria and wrap up the simulation background.
